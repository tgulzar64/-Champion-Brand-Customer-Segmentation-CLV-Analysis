# 🏆 Champion Brand Customer Segmentation & CLV Analysis  
*RFM-Based Marketing Strategy Using SAS Studio*

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project applies **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation** to Champion's customer base of 20,907 users, delivering data-driven marketing strategies for the brand's transition to Authentic Brands Group ownership. Using **SAS Studio**, we identified four distinct customer segments and developed targeted campaigns to maximize customer lifetime value (CLV) and optimize marketing spend allocation.

## 💼 Business Context

**Challenge:** Champion (acquired by Authentic Brands Group in September 2024) needed to strengthen its direct-to-consumer (DTC) business through personalized marketing and improved customer retention.

**Objective:** Leverage behavioral segmentation to:
- Reward high-value customers for loyalty
- Increase purchase frequency among mid-tier customers  
- Reactivate inactive customers with targeted incentives

---

## 📊 Methodology

**Data Analysis Approach:**
- **RFM Model:** Evaluated customers based on Recency (days since last purchase), Frequency (number of purchases), and Monetary value (total spend)
- **Segmentation:** Used mean values to categorize 20,907 customers into 4 strategic segments
- **CLV Calculation:** Estimated lifetime value for budget allocation optimization

**SAS Studio Techniques:**
- Rank Data task for quantile-based RFM classification
- Correlation Matrix to identify variable relationships
- Box Plot analysis for outlier detection
